# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

INTRODUCTION:

In this project, we will build various predictive models to predict if a given transaction is a normal payment or fraud. The features in the dataset have been scaled and name of the features is not disclosed due to privacy reasons.

GOALS:

Understand the distribution of the data.
Create a 50-50 sub-dataframe ratio of "Fraud" & "Non-Fraud" transactions as the dataset is highly imbalanced.
Determine the classifiers to use in order to predict the type of transaction on the basis of accuracy and other parameters.
Create a Neural Network and comapre the accuracy of the classifiers.
